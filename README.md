## Taxonomies and WooCommerce


WooCommerce adds a product post_type attribute to the wp_posts database table. In wordpress-speak a new taxonomy. A taxonomy needs to be supported by a theme. Before we activate the WooCommerce plugin we need to activate a theme that knows about the product taxonomy.

Once we activate the theme we can also activate WooCommerce. WooCommerce takes you through a setup wizard:
